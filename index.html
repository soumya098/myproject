    If you are planning to become a network administrator or a network architect, you will definitely need to know about Ethernet and Ethernet switching.
    The two most prominent LAN technologies in use today are Ethernet and WLAN. 
    Ethernet supports bandwidths of up to 100 Gbps, which explains its popularity. 
    This module contains a lab using Wireshark in which you can look at Ethernet frames and another lab where you view network device MAC addresses. 
    There are also some instructional videos to help you better understand Ethernet.
    By the time you have finished this module, you too could create a switched network that uses Ethernet!
